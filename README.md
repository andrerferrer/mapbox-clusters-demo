# GOAL

This is a demo to show-case how to implement a map with clusters using [`MapBox GL JS`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/cluster/) and the [`geocoder` gem](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder#geocoding-objects).

This demo was created from [this demo](git@github.com:andrerferrer/geocoder-map.git#goal).

[You can also check my other demos](https://github.com/andrerferrer/dedemos/blob/master/README.md#ded%C3%A9mos).

## What needs to be done?

- Add many seeds to have clusters
- Remove markers and add clusters
- Add info windows to clusters

And we're good to go ðŸ¤“

Good Luck and Have Fun
